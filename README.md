## My process
  The first thing I did was analyze the different designs in order to start structuring the HTML code and then start with the mobile design.

  At first I had problems with the navigation design on mobile. So I created a provisional design and continued with the styles for the remaining parts. Once the CSS for the rest of the file was finished and I was satisfied with the design on both desktop and mobile, I continued with the navigation styles according to the design example.

  Once finished, I started with the JavaScript part by creating the function to open and close the menu.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

  This project has served me to continue practicing CSS using both Grid and Flexbox and reinforce what I have learned about JavaScript, as well as to recreate a design as similar as possible.

### Continued development

I will continue practicing the use of relative and absolute positions, as I was not able to add opacity to the document when opening the navigation menu.
